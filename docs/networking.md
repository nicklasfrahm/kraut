# Networking

This section describes how to manage network devices using `kraut`.

You may use `kraut` to manage the following settings on your network devices:

- **[Networks](networking/networks.md)**  
  This allows you to configure L2 networks, such as VLANs, as well as L3 networks, such as routed VLANs.

- **[Network interfaces](networking/interfaces.md)**  
  This allows you to configure L2 interfaces, such as access and trunk VLAN ports, as well as L3 interfaces, such as routed VLAN ports or point-to-point links.
